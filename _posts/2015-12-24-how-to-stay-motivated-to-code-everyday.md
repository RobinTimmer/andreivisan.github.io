Just finished reading an amazing book called The War of Art, written by Steven Pressfield.
This is one of the few books that gave me a complete new look at the craft of programming and why what we create is art and how we can give it more than we actually do.
A while ago, after reading again John Resig's post about coding everyday, I decided I should do the same since I have quite a few projects I started, and do believe in them but they seem to never end.
Maybe as a coincidence, just after finishing this post, I started reading The War of Art which came as a deeper explanation to why we should dedicate more to our craft and also explained very well what keeps us back from doing so.
Everyone of us, believed at one point, that external factors are blocking us from sitting down everyday and do what essentially we love the most, coding. We all thought that maybe a cold, a fight with our partner, a crying baby, life, an unsatisfactory job, a not so big income etc. caused us not to sit down and put the work to finish something that we so enthusiastically started but we never seem to finish. In this book , the author clearly explains that all the above is called Resistance, and that is not caused by those external factors, but by internal ones, and that essentially we let all those factors take the shape of Resistance and win over us. We, thus postponed sitting down and doing our task, and by doing this we found that tomorrow we postponed again, and postponing became a habit , procrastination became a habit, Resistance won, and we were never able to finish our work. This built frustration, frustration built unhappiness and we started question our love for the craft.
There is also a mystic side to the book, which makes sense even to a person like myself. I am not a believer in mystic gods or angels, which made me a bit skeptical when I read about Muses that eventually are angels sent by God to whisper creativity in our ears (maybe read again this part to put i more accurately).
But then I read about the following quote:

"Eternity is in love with the creation of time", William Blake.

The way Steven Pressfield explains this made so much sense and humbled me on the spot. The way he explains is that whatever we create, any work of art we create or witness already exists or existed before it was brought up to reality. It existed in another sphere, an immaterial one, one that is governed by Muses and angels. The Muses and angels whisper these creations that seem creations of a genius to the artists that deserve and earned the right to materialize these creations. In other words, the more you sit down and work , the more you give to your craft , the more you code  and learn every night, the more is given to you because you earned the right to materialize great concepts.(Also read more about this to render it more accurately).

Another concept that totally identified to what we're doing is Territorial orientation. There is also a hierarchical orientation, one that makes us create for what sells, one that makes us act from the perspective of the external , critical eye of society. This kind of orientation is wrong and will never bring satisfaction, this is for "hacks" - people that are not true artists, people that are not dedicated to their craft, but to a superfluous hierarchical scale.
The territorial orientation is the one that gives us satisfaction, the one that makes us be, masters of our territory. When Arnold goes into the gym he is the master of that territory, when we sit down at our desks we are masters of that territory and that gives us the power to continue , that strengthens the fact that we are not hacks , we are the real deal , and our job is to code, and finish the creation at hand.(read more and refine this too).

As a conclusion, we need to sit down every night, even after a grueling day at work and code, exercise the craft we were give, master the territory we can master and deserve that inspiration and success that are given to the one that works, that fights Resistance in all its forms.
It may sound crazy, but I really encourage you to read this book, read it with an opened mind and you'll be encouraged to get all those lingering projects to an end. That will give you the power to code more even tho they might not be successful, but they will place us on a path of creation that will eventually lead to success.
