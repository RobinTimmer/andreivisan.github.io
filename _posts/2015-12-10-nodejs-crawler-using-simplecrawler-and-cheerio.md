### Intorduction

In this post I will show you how to use two very popular Node.js modules in order to create a web crawler and also how to parse the data that you have crawled and structure it the way you want.
One of the main motivations for writing this post was the fact that I had to build a pretty complex web crawler and I found that <a href="https://github.com/cgiffard/node-simplecrawler" target="_blank"> simplecrawler </a> is an awesome Node.js module but there are not so many tutorials on how to use it besides the documentation provided by the author.
You can find the full code for this tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/andreivisan/node-crawler" target="_blank"> my Github </a> account.
