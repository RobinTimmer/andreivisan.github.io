Unit testing in Android is definitely a very challenging task. I find unit testing to be a critical component in raising the standard for the quality of any Android app. Besides being and Android developer, I am an Android user and I can objectively say that the quality of a big number of apps in the Google Play store is not as high as it should be and I think that a lot has to do with unit testing or the lack thereof.

The biggest challenge I found while writing unit tests in Android is injecting mock objects into activities.
