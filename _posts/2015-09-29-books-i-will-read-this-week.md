published: true
---

I decided that I will start making a new serie of blog posts called <b>Books I Will Read This Week</b>.
Every start of the week (Monday or Tuesday) I will put a list of three books I will read for the week to come.
The week after I will review each one of the three books I was reading the previous week and publish a new list.

This week list is: 

### Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger

This book is an autobiography of Arnold Schwarzenegger and was published in November 2013. Whether you are or not a fan of Arnold I consider this book a must read for any person that wants not only to be a goal setter but also to accomplish his/her goals. Arnold is one of the few people who managed to set high goals and accomplish every one of them.

### I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi
