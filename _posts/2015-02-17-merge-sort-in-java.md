### Merge sort definition
Merge sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. Merge sort is also considered a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 

### Divide and Conquer definition
Divide and Conquer is an algorithm paradigm based on multi branched recursion. The algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
