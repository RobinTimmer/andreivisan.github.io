### Merge sort definition
Merge sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. Merge sort is also considered a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 

### Divide and Conquer definition
Divide and Conquer is an algorithm paradigm based on multi branched recursion. The algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

### Merge sort algorithm explanation
Let's consider an array with the following values: 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6. The image bellow shows how using the divide and conquer paradigm we implement the merge sort algorithm in order to sort the array.
