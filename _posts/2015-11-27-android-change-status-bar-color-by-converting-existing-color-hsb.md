### Introduction

This will be a very short post but I decided to write about this topic since I had to deal with it myself and couldn't find many resources that were helpful. I also find it an interesting problem since with the new Material Design you might have a toolbar and you want the status bar to be a darker shade of the same color.

### The problem
