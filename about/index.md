My name is Andrei Visan and this is my technical blog. I am a passionate software engineer who is interested in new technologies but also in learning and applying best practices in every piece of code I write. I am a strong believer in sharing knowledge with the community and also learn from others.

I am a web developer as well as a mobile developer. I have deep knowledge in Java SE and EE as well as in Spring framework, Hibernate framework and also in JavaScript technologies like Node.js. As far as the mobile is concerned I have deep knowledge in Android development. I would consider myself an all round developer with more than 8 years of software development experience in all areas of a software product.

Currently I live and work in Amsterdam and I like to participate in technical meetups and events.
